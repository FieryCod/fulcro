# Getting Started

Fulcro has a number of resources that can get you going.

## Developer's Tutorial

The [Developer's Tutorial](https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-tutorial) is an interactive guide to the
basics.

You can also [read it online](tutorial.html).

## Developer's Guide

The [Developer's Guide](http://book.fulcrologic.com) covers the entire
library, and also has a Getting Started chapter that is great for beginners.

## Video Guides

There is a playlist of videos for different topics. This playlist is expanding, so check back often:

## Talks About Untangled

I've given a few talks on Untangled, which was the root project of Fulcro. The names are out of date, but
the concepts are still the same. Use the playlist control at
the top-left of the video to choose what you want to watch.

## API Documentation

Most functions have good doc strings that explain the purpose of the function. Use your IDE's help to see these documentation elements.
