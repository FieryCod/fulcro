Fulcro is a library for building data-driven full-stack applications for the web. It uses React and is written in
Clojure and Clojurescript.

*NOTE*: If you are using Java 9, you may need to include "--add-modules java.xml.bind" to your JVM.

== Version Differences

Fulcro has undergone a number of face-lifts over its lifetime.

[[Horizontal]]
1.x:: An add-on library for Om Next. Has various limitations as a result of this, and several bugs that are deep within Om Next (which was not getting updates).
2.0 - 2.4:: No longer depends on Om Next. Public API is the same, except where improvements and fixes were needed.
2.5:: Integrated co-located CSS for better support (e.g. localized-dom), made all server dependencies dynamic, rewrite of i18n. This
version requires you to change a few i18n things if you were using it, and adds API to the DOM to make UI much more concise.
2.6:: Changes for React 16+. Changes in React led to a change in the underlying rendering refresh
optimizations.
3.0:: This version. A nearly complete rewrite of the internals.  Simplifies a lot of things, makes others
more extensible, and preserves the shape of the API; however, it is not 100% API compatible with prior versions.  In
particular in the course of fixing some long-standing issues subtle semantic differences were desirable/unavoidable in the
transaction processing system.

== Trying it Out

The documentation is mostly correct in the Developer's Guide.

`defsc`:: The new `defsc` *looks* like the old one, and even does
some of the same error checking (NOTE: there is a known bug in the new props destructuring checks I have not had time
to fix...the workaround is to use lambda query/ident if you run into it). However, `defsc`'s option map support user-additions.
Anything you include in that map now appears (unaltered) in `component-options`.  This allows library authors to co-locate
information on a component without having to modify the macro.  The "magic" behaviors of query/ident/initial-state (and error
checking) are still present for developer aid and bw compatibility.  Some of the arities may be wrong. I was considering
making them all lambdas at one point and may have screwed something up. Please report any issues.

=== Creating An Application

Fulcro applications no longer use anything from Om Next. There are no protocols, no reconciler, etc. A Fulcro application
is implemented as a map, and that `app` is usable everywhere the reconciler was in 2.x. There is no need to store it
in an atom because it uses atoms internally to deal with state.

For hot code reload, you should use `defonce` to make your application in some central location that can be used from
any other namespace:

```
(ns my.app
  (:require
    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.networking.http-remote :as fhr]
    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application :as app]
    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.components :as comp]
    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.data-fetch :as df]
    [my.app.ui :as ui]
    [taoensso.timbre :as log]))

(defonce app (app/fulcro-app {:remotes   {:remote (fhr/fulcro-http-remote {:url "/api"})}}))
```

At some point in your logic you will want to associate the root of your UI with the application via `app/mount!`:

```
(app/mount! app ui/Root "app")
```

=== Significant Changes

I call these significant more for their long-term implications than their impact on existing code.  Most existing
code will be trivial to port to Fulcro 3, and should operate without much further change; however, some of the
"hard edges" of Fulcro 2 are solved by these changes, and as such they are "significant" in that sense.

==== Defsc

As mentioned earlier: `defsc` no longer uses protocols at all.  The options map is "beefed up" but the `defsc` macro,
but in fact you can simply create a "contructor function" and call `configure-component!` on it and pass a non-magic
options map to create a component.  The macro just helps you with typos and is easier to read.

This also means things like CSS can now be a pure library concern (and in fact, fulcro-garden-css is where that
functionality lives now).

NOTE: Some things that *were* macros in Fulcro 2.x no longer need to be.  The incubator dynamic routers are an example
of this.  The old union router is still a custom macro because it actually emits more than one thing.

==== Transact Changes

The most significant change is in `transact!`, which is now in the `component` namespace.  Transactions are now safe
to submit from *anywhere* in the code base, even from within helpers that are running within `swap!` against the state
atom!

The `transact!` function just puts the tx on a submission queue.  That's it.  At some point in the (very) near future
Fulcro will process the current submissions into an active queue.

This simplifies a lot of things:

- You no longer need `ptransact!`.  Just embed a `transact!` in the `ok-action` of your mutation.
- Timing issues in dynamic routing and ui state machines should be easier to avoid/solve.
- You can submit transactions without using `setTimeout`, and be sure they will activate in the order submitted.


==== Mutation Generalizations

Mutations have become an even more central notion in the library.  All versions of Fulcro have actually treated loads
internally as mutations, because in fact a load is a combination of some state changes (recording the fact that something
is loading) and fetching the actual data.

Prior versions of Fulcro had Om Next structure in the middle.  Version 3 does not.  The logic in 3 is *much* more direct:

- A transaction is written as it always has been
- Each element of the transaction (mutations) can choose local and remote behaviors
- Optimistic actions run first
- Network actions go on a queue and run in order

All of that should sound pretty much identical to what you've been doing all along.  The big difference is what
happens next:

- Network results are delivered *straight* to the `result-action` of the mutation.  If the user does not supply a `result-action`,
then the `defmutation` macro supplies a default that behaves like Fulcro 2.

As a result any full-stack operation is completely under your control:

```
(defmutation do-thing [params]
  (action [env] ...optimistic actions...)
  (remote [env] true)
  (ok-action [env] ...your custom action type!...)
  (result-action [{:keys [result app handlers] :as env}]
    (let [{:keys [status-code body]} result
          {:keys [ok-action]} handlers]
      (if (= 200 status-code)
        (ok-action env)
        ...))))
```

This maintains backward compatibility while also giving you the power to implement things like
`pmutate` from incubator without having to resort to magical transaction transforms.   The fact that
you can trigger new transactions from any part of that code means that chaining behaviors is now
trivial and no longer needs the concept of `ptransact!` (though there is an `:optimistic? false` option
of the new `transact!` that emulates that behavior.

Interestingly, this also makes it super easy to generalize loads even more than before.
Loads are now implemented something like this (simplified for ease of understanding):

```
(defmutation internal-load! [{:keys [remote query marker] :as params}]
  (action [{:keys [app]}] (set-load-marker! app marker :loading))
  (result-action [{:keys [result app] :as env}]
      (if (load-error? result)
        (load-failed! env params)
        (finish-load! env params))))
  (remote  [{:keys [ast]}] (eql/query->ast query)))
```

and the `data-fecth` API just internally calls `transact!` for you.

WARNING: The multimethod `mutate` is still at the center of this; however, the arguments have changed.  The multimethod
is sent *only* an `env`, which contains `(-> env :ast :params)`.



=== Using Inspect

Do NOT include Fulcro Inspect as a dependency.  Instead, Fulcro now includes the client-side code necessary to talk
to the Chrome extension without pulling in all of inspect's dependencies  in your project.  Just add the following
preload:

```
 :builds   {:app  {:target     :browser
                   ...
                   :devtools   {:preloads [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.inspect.preload]}}
```

At the the db, transactions, and network tab are known to mostly work.  Expanding Inspect to include some cool
new features is one of my top priorities.  I want to support better helpers for UI state machines, perhaps some UI
performance monitoring, etc.

=== Known Issues

- If you use link/ident joins in UI queries the new optimal render may miss refreshes. Use `with-optimized-renderer` in
`application-helpers` (see the doc string) to select keyframe rendering if you have problems.
-

- Some Inspect features are not implemented.
- Inspect transactions report the before/after db as the same every time, even though it is changing (this has to do
with changes in how transactions are processed internally...the inspect hook isn't hooked up in the right places).
-

== Status

Version 3 is now officially in Alpha.  Most APIs have been ported, and some have been tested.  Some code (CSS and websockets)
was moved to external libraries to reduce complexity and dependencies.

The basic data fetch API has been ported, so most of a full-stack working app can be written (and is in the repo
as todomvc).  Only the port of HTTP network layer remains before we have something usable for full-stack.

The general road map (with status) is:

* Rewrite Transaction Internals (100% done, but needs more integration testing)
** Write tx processing that is extensible, and can support all currently-known use-cases (100%)
** Make tx system pluggable (100%)
** Support for new tx-combining at network layer (designed, not implemented)
** New `defmutation` (possibly to be renamed) (100%)
*** Support for `result-action` (100%)
*** Support for "extensible" mutation semantics (100%)
*** Support for quote-free transactions (100%)

* Network Layer (100%)
** Write adapters or otherwise build new remote networking

* Merge Logic (100%)
** Split merge routines into easily reusable bits (100%)
** Make it possible for users to easily choose/customize merge strategy (100%)
** Figure out the right place to put helpers like integrate-ident, etc. (100%)

* App DB normalization/denormalization (100%)
** Improve performance of `db->tree` (100%, up to 6x faster)
** Factor logic out into clear namespaces (100%)
** Add better tests (100%)

* Components
** Support for React class-based components (100%)
*** Rewrite of `defsc` (100%)
**** Drop protocols (100%)
**** Support extensibility  (90% complete)
** Turn component-local CSS into a pure library concern (100%)
** Turn i18n into a pure library concern (easy)

* Move UI State Machines into this library (90%, needs more testing)

* Move Dynamic Router into this library (90%, needs more testing)

* Move to EQL as Source of AST logic (100%)

* Minimize dependencies (100%)

* Nice to Haves (depends a bit on contributors)
** React Hooks-based `defsc` (designed and prototyped, but needs integration work)
