Fulcro is a library for building data-driven full-stack applications for the web. It uses React, is written in
Clojure and Clojurescript (so it has first-class functional abilities with immutable data) which leads to a clean
synchronous story for the UI. The primary design goals are:

. Provide structure and patterns that encourage simplicity in overall design.
. Provide an out-of-the box experience that is as easy as possible, except where it conflicts with the first goal.

*NOTE*: If you are using Java 9, you may need to include "--add-modules java.xml.bind" to your JVM.

== Version Differences

Fulcro has undergone a number of face-lifts over its lifetime.

[[Horizontal]]
1.x:: An add-on library for Om Next. Has various limitations as a result of this, and several bugs that are deep within Om Next (which was not getting updates).
2.0 - 2.4:: No longer depends on Om Next. Public API is the same, except where improvements and fixes were needed.
2.5:: Integrated co-located CSS for better support (e.g. localized-dom), made all server dependencies dynamic, rewrite of i18n. This
version requires you to change a few i18n things if you were using it, and adds API to the DOM to make UI much more concise.
2.6:: Changes for React 16+. Changes in React led to a change in the underlying rendering refresh
optimizations.

=== Leiningen Template

Experienced users that want to dive right in can use the `lein` template. This template will save you a lot of effort
in green-field development, as it emits a project that is already set up with
full-stack support, development modes, testing (including CI), uberjar, and even
workspaces support:

```
lein new fulcro my-project
```

It generates a lein-based project that uses shadow-cljs for easy use of NPM js dependencies.  We've found
shadow-cljs to be a lot better overall experience than figwheel with the default cljs compiler.

If you don't know Clojure, you should at least get comfortable with the basics.
I recommend: http://www.braveclojure.com/[Clojure for the Brave and True], and doing at least the
basic online exercises at http://www.4clojure.com/[4Clojure]. You should also have
a passing familiarity with Facebook's React, though if you understand that we're
using it to get "fast UI updates", that is sufficient to start.

== Contributors

Fulcro is maintained by Fulcrologic, LLC. The primary architect and maintainer is Tony Kay.

Fulcro expands on the work of David Nolen's Om Next, and that code represents about 30% of 2.0's code base.
Much of the core API is similar, but this
library is intended to be an easier-to-use alternative that follows the original simplicity of design while eliminating
some experimental features of that library, and rounding out the story with a complete concrete implementation
that is easy to use.

Many people have contributed to this library. Much of the original internal work was part of Om Next and
as written by David Nolen. Some of the contributions of Antonio Monteiro have also been incorporated.

Fulcro itself originated as an effort of Navis in Bend, Oregon. Tony Kay was the primary architect, and numerous people
contributed in that original project (known as Untangled).

Fulcro can therefore be considered a fork of Untangled and Om Next.

See the github statistics for information on all contributors.
