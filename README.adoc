Fulcro is a library for building data-driven full-stack applications for the web. It uses React and is written in
Clojure and Clojurescript.

*NOTE*: If you are using Java 9, you may need to include "--add-modules java.xml.bind" to your JVM.

== Version Differences

Fulcro has undergone a number of face-lifts over its lifetime.

[[Horizontal]]
1.x:: An add-on library for Om Next. Has various limitations as a result of this, and several bugs that are deep within Om Next (which was not getting updates).
2.0 - 2.4:: No longer depends on Om Next. Public API is the same, except where improvements and fixes were needed.
2.5:: Integrated co-located CSS for better support (e.g. localized-dom), made all server dependencies dynamic, rewrite of i18n. This
version requires you to change a few i18n things if you were using it, and adds API to the DOM to make UI much more concise.
2.6:: Changes for React 16+. Changes in React led to a change in the underlying rendering refresh
optimizations.
3.0:: This version. A nearly complete rewrite of the internals.  Simplifies a lot of things, makes others
more extensible, and preserves the shape of the API; however, it is not 100% API compatible with prior versions.
We hope to provide an API-compatibility layer that will make porting older apps easier; however,
some of the improved internals do change a few operational semantics.

== Status

This project is not *even* alpha yet.  It is nearly complete enough to write a full-stack working app, but there is a
lot of work remaining.  The general road map (with status) is:

* Rewrite Transaction Internals (80% done)
** Write tx processing that is extensible, and can support all currently-known use-cases (90%)
** Make tx system pluggable (designed, but maybe 40% implemented)
** Support for new tx-combining at network layer (designed, not implemented)
** New `defmutation` (possibly to be renamed) (80%)
*** Support for `result-action` (80%)
*** Support for "extensible" mutation semantics (100%)
*** Support for quote-free transactions (100%)

* Network Layer (0%)
** Write adapters or otherwise build new remote networking

* Merge Logic (90%)
** Split merge routines into easily reusable bits (100%)
** Make it possible for users to easily choose/customize merge strategy (100%)
** Figure out the right place to put helpers like integrate-ident, etc.

* App DB normalization/denormalization (90%)
** Improve performance of `db->tree` (100%, up to 6x faster)
** Factor logic out into clear namespaces (100%)
** Add better tests (0%)

* Components
** Support for React class-based components (90%)
*** Rewrite of `defsc` (90%)
**** Drop protocols (100%)
**** Support extensibility  (90% complete)
** Turn component-local CSS into a pure library concern (easy to do)
** Turn i18n into a pure library concern (easy)

* Move UI State Machines into this library (0%)

* Move Dynamic Router into this library (0%)

* Move to EQL as Source of AST logic (50%)

* Minimize dependencies (100%)

* Nice to Haves (depends a bit on contributors)
** React Hooks-based `defsc` (designed and prototyped, but needs integration work)
